# Download this pack, put it into the packs folder, go in-game and execute /ir std o volcanic.

## Pack is currently WIP. So some missing objects, object spawn frequency might be too low/high, maybe some terrain changes.

## If you wanna integrate it into the overworld:

1. 

Copy the 2 biomes. (Lava Ocean and Volcanic Mountains)<br>
Place them into the *biomes* folder.

2. 

Copy the generator volcanic.<br>
Place the file into the *generators* folder.

3.

Copy the region volcanic.<br>
Place the file into the regions folder.

4.

Copy the folder *volcanic* in the objects directory.<br>
Place the folder into the objects directory.

5.

Open the overworld.json.<br>
Search for *regions []*.<br>
Add the region *volcanic* into the list.

6.

Start server, do /ir std o overworld, use /ir std goto volcanic-mountains.<br>
Have fun!
